    <h1 class="page-heading">Connectathon</h1>

    <p>The initial commitment of INTEROPen is to the design and demonstration (via a connectathon) of structured data exchange using profiles based on the emerging FHIR standard, exchange of data being across seven health and social care domains in support of a patientâ€™s care pathway.</p>
    <p>The seven domains are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GP</li>
      <li>Mental Health</li>
      <li>A&amp;E</li>
      <li>Community Nursing</li>
      <li>Specialist Outpatient</li>
      <li>Social Care</li>
      <li>The citizen and their family</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The connectathon is underpinned by the story of Michael, a person with alcoholism, and diabetes and their contacts with the various services, focusing on the need for real time up-to-date data exchange between systems in each domain.</p>

    <p>The following documents were introduced at INTEROPen 4 and provide the story of Michael along with use cases for the connectathon:
    
      <ul>
        <li><a href="content/IO4%20-%20Michael's%20Story%20-%20Introduction.pdf">Michael's story - introduction</a></li>
        <li><a href="content/IO4%20-%20Michael's%20Story%20-%20Slides.pdf">Michael's story - use cases</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

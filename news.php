			<p>At the recent <a href="http://www.interopsummit.com">interopsummit</a> panel debate, it was announced that leaders of interoperability networks (C4H, HL7UK, techUK, PRSB, BCS, CCIO/CIO network, OpenEHR, NHS Digital, NHS England) have agreed to 
			work to establish how they can come together under an umbrella group called INTEROPen, whilst keeping the INTEROPen T+C/values/purpose/aims.

			<p><a href="content/INTEROPen%20governance%20discussions.pdf">This is a request to the INTEROPen membership</a> for OPEN feedback – via the <a href="https://interopen.ryver.com/index.html#forums/1106270">RYVER GOVERNANCE FORUM CHAT</a> - on how our governance structure could evolve.</p>
			<p>INTEROPen has been established for just over 1 year and continues to grow with organisations (vendor, provider, standards and clinical) joining weekly.</p>

		  <div class="news-text">
			<p>The Code4Health Interoperability Community Board endorsed this paper and its recommendations.  FHIR tooling is not quite mature enough to drive the clinical engagement to help define clinical user requirements and use cases.  This is an opportunity for members to share their initial thoughts on this paper.  The NHS Digital team plans to initiate this in collaboration with community input.  This should be an exciting project to help further popularise and engage clinicians and technician in FHIR.</p>

		  <p class="news-meta">29 December 2016 &nbsp; Will Smart, NHS England CIO</p>
		  <div class="news-text">
			<p><a href="content/Interoperability%20Summit%20-%20Emerging%20Target%20Architecture%20v1-0.pdf">This is a paper</a> summarising the outputs from an Interoperability and Population Health Summit that was convened by Will Smart, NHS England CIO, in November 2016.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the summit was to bring together national and international experts to explore the challenges associated with enabling data to flow across the health and social care system to support the provision of the best possible care to citizens.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the target architecture paper is to explore the design of such a target architecture, to support the direction of travel to</p>
            <ul>
              <li>OPEN APIs (e.g. CareConnnect)</li>
              <li>(Near) Real time data access for direct patient care</li>
              <li>Near real time data access for analytics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A key recommendation is that a target architecture (or platform for sharing) is at a regional level of populations from 2 to 5 million, adopting national standards (e.g. CareConnect), supported by national capabilities and integrated also with the emerging National Data Platform.</p>
            <p>INTEROPen members are recognised stakeholders in providing feedback - please log in to RYVER for details on how to provide feedback by noon Monday 16th January.</p>

          <p class="news-title">Proposal for INTEROPen to “OPEN" its membership [HAVE YOUR SAY]</p>
          <p class="news-meta">12 Sep 2016 &nbsp; Amir Mehrkar</p>
          <div class="news-text">
            <p>Since INTEROPen4 in July, a growing number of non-vendor organisations and individuals with valuable technical and clinical knowledge of the technologies we supply, and the standards needed to enable interoperability, have requested to contribute to INTEROPen’s important standards work.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we have not been able to invite them to our membership. These include NHS provider and commissioner IT teams.</p>
            <p>However, our mission statement makes it clear that we are here to work together to accelerate the development of open standards for interoperability, whilst putting commercial interests aside.</p>
            <p>In addition, the recent report, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/550866/Wachter_Review_Accessible.pdf">Making IT Work</a>, chaired by Dr Robert Wachter, focused heavily on “interoperability”, specifically stating:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"National standards for interoperability should be developed and enforced, with an expectation of widespread interoperability of core data elements by 2020”</li>
              <li>"Widespread interoperability will require the development and enforcement of standards, along with penalties for suppliers, trusts, GPs, and others who stand in the way of appropriate data sharing."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It, therefore, appears that the role of INTEROpen, is set to become an even more vital piece in the transformation of our NHS for safer and more efficient patient care.</p>
            <p>As a result, <b>a proposal has been put forward that we OPEN our MEMBERSHIP to non-vendor organisations and individuals with technical and clinical expertise in health and social care interoperability standards development.</b></p>
            <p><b>The proposal has been supported enthusiastically by the following members:</b></p>
            <p>Blackpear, Cerner, Emis Health, Endeavour, Healthcare Gateway, IMS Maxims, InterSystems, Microsoft, Orion Health, TPP, including NHS Digital.</p>
            <p><b><span class="red">ACTION FOR MEMBERS:</span> If you have any objection to this please contact us at <a class="emaila" href="">.</a> <span class="red">by 16/09/2016</span> with your justification, or use SLACK to discuss openly.</b></p>
            <p><b>If no objections are raised we will open up the SLACK forum without delay and update our website and twitter feeds accordingly.</b></p>

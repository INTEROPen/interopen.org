  <h1 class="page-heading">Standards development</h1>

  <h3>The goal</h3>

  <p>To adapt the HL7速 FHIR速 standard and create a library of profiles (resources and interaction patterns) that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.</p>

  <p>This section covers the establishment of a set of specifications of resource profiles and FHIR APIs, for the purposes of communication across different clinical settings, referred to as "Care-Connect".</p>

  <h3>Outputs</h3>

  <p>A Library of HL7速 FHIR速 resource profiles and interaction patterns (APIs).</p>

  <p>Once having established a consensus with INTEROPen members these will be submitted for clinical validation and feedback by a wider group of stakeholders, the lead clinical validation organisation being <a href="http://theprsb.org">the PRSB</a>.</p>

  <h3>Methodology</h3>

  <p>The methodology is evolving <a href="https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-methodology">and is held on GitHub</a>.</p>

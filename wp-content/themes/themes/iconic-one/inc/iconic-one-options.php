<h4>Responsive Menu - Important! - Update: Dec 14 2013.</h4> 
This is the first step: Configure the Main Navigation menu for mobile view by
going to Appearance -> Menus. Create your WordPress menu as per your requirement and select it as <b>primary menu</b>, Navigation Menu responsiveness won't work otherwise.
<h4>Using Live Customizer - for logo upload, colors etc.</h4> 
<h2>Starting from version 1.2 you can access the live customizer from the <b>Appearance menu >> Customize Iconic One.</b></h2>
Alternatively you can go through the Live Customizer ( http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/customize.php )
to upload the logo image, set the social bookmarks and footer copyright texts, background color etc., 
you don't have to touch any code or login to ftp for the most needed customizations. Sidebar is Widget ready for easy configuration. 
<h4>Logo Size</h4>
Logo of 187 x 54 pixel dimensions is used in the demo. 
You can easily try uploading logos of different sizes via live customizer. Version 1.2 now comes with support for bigger logos. Refer to changelog.txt in the home directory.
